INPUT:
- Idea: ${onboarding.idea}
- Problem: ${onboarding.problem}
- Target Customer: ${onboarding.target_customer}
- Features: ${featuresStr}

QUESTION FOCUS RULES:
${focusPriority}

FEATURE-BASED INDIRECT PROBES (use these as inspiration for natural questions):
${featureProbes || "No specific features listed."}

CONTEXT USAGE RULES:
- Use context to guide question direction
- Do NOT pitch, validate, or directly reference the idea in a biased way
- The interview must feel natural, not like a survey

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT ask for opinions (e.g. "Would you use this?")
- Do NOT ask hypotheticals (e.g. "If this existed...")
- Do NOT lead toward confirming the idea
- Focus ONLY on past behavior and real experiences
- Every question must extract specific, real examples

OUTPUT STRUCTURE (exactly 6 sections):
1. OPENING (2–3 questions) — casual context-building
2. INTERVIEWEE BACKGROUND (2–3 questions) — understand their role, experience level, and how relevant this problem is to their day-to-day life; use this to calibrate the rest of the interview
3. CURRENT BEHAVIOR (3–4 questions) — how they handle the problem today
4. PAIN & FRICTION (3–4 questions) — where the process breaks down
5. WORKAROUNDS / ALTERNATIVES (2–3 questions) — hacks and substitutes
6. IMPACT & PRIORITY (2–3 questions) — frequency and stakes

For EVERY main question include 1–2 follow-up probes such as:
"Can you walk me through the last time?", "What happened step-by-step?", "Why was that difficult?"

STYLE: Very casual, conversational, human — not scripted or corporate.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact structure:
